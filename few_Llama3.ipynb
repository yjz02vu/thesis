      "(Note: I'm asking this question to assess if they're doing a thorough job of washing their face, paying attention to specific areas that might be difficult for someone with limited dexterity or vision)P: Ah, yes! When I wash my face in the morning and evening, I make sure to use a gentle cleanser and I take my time to thoroughly rinse off all dirt and makeup. I pay extra attention to the areas around my nose and mouth, making sure to get all the creases and folds clean.F: That's great! It sounds like you're taking your time and being methodical when washing your face, especially in areas that can be hard to reach. Can you tell me more about how you're handling any stubborn or difficult areas of skin, such as the sides of your nose or around your mouth? Do you find yourself having trouble getting into those areas with soap and water?P: Actually, I do have some difficulty getting into those small creases and folds. Sometimes I'll use a gentle exfoliating scrub to help loosen any stubborn dirt or impurities before washing my face. It seems to make it easier for me to get a good clean in those areas. And if I'm having trouble reaching certain spots, I'll often tilt my head back slightly so I can get better access with the washcloth or sponge.F: That's clever! Using an exfoliating scrub before washing your face is a great technique to help loosen dirt and impurities.
