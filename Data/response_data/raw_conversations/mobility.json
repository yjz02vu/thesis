How was the experience of travelling with an animal like an elephant?\n\nP: It was a bit intimidating at first, but it was very smooth and, surprisingly, quite comfortable.\n\nC: Do you remember any specific memories or sights you saw during that elephant ride that stand out to you?\n\nP: I remember feeling so high up and being able to see everything below so clearly. It was truly a unique way to travel and see the surroundings. Can*t"
